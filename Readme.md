## Installation

To get started with Jarvis, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Jarvis.git
cd Jarvis
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional, but recommended)
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  .venv\Scriptsctivate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start Jarvis and interact with it via voice commands.

### Step 1: Run Jarvis
To launch Jarvis, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Wake Jarvis
Say any of the following commands to wake up Jarvis:
- "Jarvis"
- "Hey Jarvis"
- "Jarvis wake up"
- "Wake up Jarvis"

### Step 3: Give Commands
Once Jarvis is awake, you can give commands such as:
- "Open YouTube"
- "Open Google"
- "Open Stack Overflow"
- "Exit" (Shuts down the program)
- "Go to sleep" (Deactivates Jarvis, but keeps the program running)

Jarvis will respond to your commands and perform actions like opening websites, searching, and more.
